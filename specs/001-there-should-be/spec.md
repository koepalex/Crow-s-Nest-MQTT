# Feature Specification: Delete Topic Command

**Feature Branch**: `001-there-should-be`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "There should be a command :deletetopic that \"delete\" all retain messages in that topic and all sub topics, Delete topic mean send a retain message with empty payload to the topic of the original retain message."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an MQTT developer, I want to clear all retained messages from a topic and its subtopics so that I can clean up stale data or reset topic state during development and testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a topic tree with retained messages on `sensors/temperature` and `sensors/temperature/living-room`, **When** I execute `:deletetopic sensors/temperature`, **Then** empty retained messages are published to both topics clearing all retained data
2. **Given** a selected topic `devices/status` in the topic tree, **When** I execute `:deletetopic` without arguments, **Then** the currently selected topic and all its subtopics have their retained messages cleared
3. **Given** no retained messages exist on a topic, **When** I execute `:deletetopic sensors/nonexistent`, **Then** the command completes successfully without error

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the topic pattern matches hundreds of subtopics with retained messages?
- How does the system handle MQTT broker disconnection during the delete operation?
- What happens when user lacks publish permissions to some of the matched topics?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `:deletetopic` command accessible via the command palette
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an optional topic pattern argument (e.g., `:deletetopic sensors/temperature`)
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the currently selected topic when no argument is provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify all subtopics under the specified topic that have retained messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST publish empty payload retained messages to clear each identified topic
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback showing progress of the deletion operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all deletion attempts including success/failure status
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle MQTT broker disconnection gracefully during operation

### Key Entities
- **Topic Pattern**: The root topic specified by user or currently selected topic
- **Retained Message**: MQTT messages with retain flag that persist on the broker
- **Delete Operation**: Process of publishing empty retained messages to clear topic state
