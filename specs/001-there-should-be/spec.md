# Feature Specification: Delete Topic Command

**Feature Branch**: `001-there-should-be`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "There should be a command :deletetopic that \"delete\" all retain messages in that topic and all sub topics, Delete topic mean send a retain message with empty payload to the topic of the original retain message."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an MQTT developer, I want to clear all retained messages from a topic and its subtopics so that I can clean up stale data or reset topic state during development and testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a topic tree with retained messages on `sensors/temperature` and `sensors/temperature/living-room`, **When** I execute `:deletetopic sensors/temperature`, **Then** empty retained messages are published to both topics clearing all retained data
2. **Given** a selected topic `devices/status` in the topic tree, **When** I execute `:deletetopic` without arguments, **Then** the currently selected topic and all its subtopics have their retained messages cleared
3. **Given** no retained messages exist on a topic, **When** I execute `:deletetopic sensors/nonexistent`, **Then** the command completes successfully without error

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the topic pattern matches hundreds of subtopics with retained messages?
- How does the system handle MQTT broker disconnection during the delete operation?
- What happens when user lacks publish permissions to some of the matched topics?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `:deletetopic` command accessible via the command palette
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an optional topic pattern argument (e.g., `:deletetopic sensors/temperature`)
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the currently selected topic when no argument is provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify all subtopics under the specified topic that have retained messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST publish empty payload retained messages to clear each identified topic
- **FR-006**: System MUST display minimal notifications in the status bar showing operation start and completion
- **FR-014**: System MUST update the MQTT topic tree to reflect removed retained message counts in real-time
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all deletion attempts including success/failure status
- **FR-008**: System MUST abort deletion operation immediately upon MQTT broker disconnection and notify user to manually restart
- **FR-009**: System MUST process all matched topics for deletion in parallel for maximum performance
- **FR-010**: System MUST continue deletion operation when encountering unauthorized topics, skipping them silently
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a summary warning at completion listing any topics that could not be deleted due to permissions
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce a configurable maximum topic limit per deletion operation, defaulting to 500 topics
- **FR-013**: System MUST warn user and require confirmation when deletion operation would exceed the configured topic limit

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: When hundreds of subtopics contain retained messages, how should the deletion operation behave? → A: Process all topics immediately in parallel (fastest but resource intensive)
- Q: When the user lacks publish permissions to some matched topics, what should happen? → A: Skip unauthorized topics silently and continue with others, but bring a summary warning at the end
- Q: What should be the maximum number of topics that can be processed in a single :deletetopic operation? → A: Configurable limit with default of 500 topics
- Q: How should the visual progress feedback be displayed during the deletion operation? → A: Minimal notification showing only start and completion messages in the normal StatusBarText, the number of messages removed should be deducted from the count shown in MQTT topic tree
- Q: When MQTT broker disconnection occurs during deletion, how should the operation resume when reconnected? → A: Abort the operation and require user to manually restart

### Key Entities
- **Topic Pattern**: The root topic specified by user or currently selected topic
- **Retained Message**: MQTT messages with retain flag that persist on the broker
- **Delete Operation**: Process of publishing empty retained messages to clear topic state
