# Research: Delete Topic Command

**Phase 0 Output** - Resolving technical unknowns and best practices for MQTT retained message deletion

## Research Questions Identified

1. **MQTT Retained Message Clearing Mechanism**: How to properly clear retained messages using MQTT protocol
2. **MQTTnet Library Capabilities**: How to implement parallel publishing with MQTTnet
3. **Topic Discovery Patterns**: How to identify all subtopics with retained messages
4. **UI Command Integration**: How to integrate with existing command palette system
5. **Performance Optimization**: Best practices for parallel MQTT operations

## Research Findings

### MQTT Retained Message Clearing Mechanism
**Decision**: Use MQTT standard approach - publish empty payload with retain flag set to true
**Rationale**: This is the standard MQTT protocol method for clearing retained messages. When a client publishes an empty message (zero-length payload) with the retain flag set, the broker removes the retained message for that topic.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Using MQTT 5.0 specific features: Rejected - need backward compatibility
- Broker-specific admin commands: Rejected - not portable across brokers

### MQTTnet Library Capabilities
**Decision**: Use MQTTnet's PublishAsync method with parallel Task execution
**Rationale**: MQTTnet supports async operations and can handle multiple concurrent publishes efficiently. The library handles connection management and error reporting.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Sequential publishing: Rejected - too slow for hundreds of topics
- Batch publishing: Available but parallel individual publishes offer better error isolation

### Topic Discovery Patterns
**Decision**: Use existing topic tree data structure from the application
**Rationale**: The application already maintains a topic tree with retained message information. We can traverse this structure to find all subtopics matching the pattern.
**Alternatives considered**:
- MQTT broker subscription to discover topics: Rejected - would require separate discovery phase and permissions
- Topic pattern matching algorithms: Use existing tree traversal for efficiency

### UI Command Integration
**Decision**: Extend existing CommandProcessor in UI layer with new DeleteTopicCommand
**Rationale**: Follows established pattern in the application for command handling. Integrates with command palette and provides consistent UX.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate command system: Rejected - would break consistency
- Direct UI button: Rejected - violates command-first principle

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Use Task.Run with bounded parallelism and CancellationToken support
**Rationale**: Prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining high performance. Allows graceful cancellation on disconnection.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Unlimited parallelism: Rejected - could overwhelm broker or network
- Thread pool management: Task.Run provides sufficient control with less complexity

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Component Interaction Flow
1. **UI Layer**: CommandProcessor receives `:deletetopic` command
2. **BusinessLogic Layer**: DeleteTopicService handles topic discovery and MQTT operations
3. **Utils Layer**: Topic pattern matching utilities, configuration management
4. **Integration**: Real-time UI updates via existing event system

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Permission Errors**: Continue operation, collect failed topics for summary
- **Network Errors**: Abort operation, log details, notify user
- **Topic Not Found**: Silent success (idempotent operation)
- **Broker Disconnection**: Immediate abort with clear user notification

### Configuration Requirements
- **MaxTopicLimit**: Default 500, user-configurable via settings
- **ParallelismDegree**: Default based on system capabilities
- **TimeoutPeriod**: Per-topic publish timeout (5 seconds default)

## Implementation Readiness
All research questions resolved. No remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION items. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design.
