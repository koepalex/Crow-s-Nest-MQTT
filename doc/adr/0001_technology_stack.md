Here’s a concise recommendation for a technology stack, along with reasoning for each choice. The main goals are **true cross-platform support** (Windows, Linux, macOS), **high performance** for large message volumes, an **approachable developer experience**, and the ability to package it as a **global tool** rather than a traditional installer.

---

## Recommended Stack

1. **.NET 7 (or later) + Avalonia UI**  
   - **Why .NET?**  
     - Cross-platform runtime that can easily produce self-contained binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
     - Excellent tooling (e.g., `dotnet tool install -g`) for global tool distribution without requiring admin privileges.  
     - Mature ecosystem for MQTT, JSON handling, and concurrency.  
   - **Why Avalonia UI?**  
     - True cross-platform desktop UI framework (unlike .NET MAUI, which doesn’t officially support Linux).  
     - Modern, XAML-based approach, similar to WPF.  
     - Theming support (dark mode), resizable panels, and good performance.

2. **MQTTnet**  
   - A popular, well-documented .NET library for MQTT.  
   - Supports MQTT v5 features like user-properties, content-type, correlation-data, etc.  
   - Well-maintained and widely used.

3. **SQLite or DuckDB** (Optional Persistence)  
   - **SQLite** is lightweight, ubiquitous, and easy to embed.  
   - **DuckDB** is a high-performance, analytical database engine that can also be embedded.  
   - Either can be integrated with .NET via existing NuGet packages.  
   - This provides the option to serialize ring buffer data for later analysis.

4. **OpenTelemetry for .NET**  
   - Provides standardized logging and metrics.  
   - Easy to export logs in various formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).  
   - Aligns with the requirement for OpenTelemetry-conformant logs and metrics.

5. **Self-Update Mechanism**  
   - In .NET, you can implement a custom solution that checks a version endpoint (e.g., a GitHub release) and then downloads/extracts the new binary.  
   - Alternatively, there are open-source libraries that simplify self-updating in .NET.  
   - This is straightforward to integrate with your global tool approach.

---

## Why This Stack?

1. **Cross-Platform Packaging**  
   - .NET allows you to create **single-file** executables for each OS.  
   - Avalonia runs on all major desktop platforms with a native look and feel.  
   - You avoid the overhead of Electron (Chromium-based) while still getting a modern UI framework.

2. **Performance & Memory**  
   - .NET 7 offers very good performance and memory management.  
   - MQTTnet is efficient and can handle high message throughput.  
   - Avalonia’s rendering is hardware-accelerated where available and generally lighter than an embedded browser approach.

3. **Developer Experience**  
   - C# has strong support for asynchronous programming (e.g., `async/await`) which is beneficial for MQTT workloads.  
   - Avalonia’s XAML-based layout is comfortable for anyone with WPF or XAML experience.  
   - Packaging as a `dotnet tool` is straightforward, and advanced configurations (like user-defined update intervals or ring buffer sizes) can be placed in a JSON settings file.

4. **Community & Ecosystem**  
   - .NET has a large ecosystem, including libraries for JSON parsing (e.g., System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json) and data access (SQLite, DuckDB).  
   - The Avalonia community is growing quickly, and there is active support on GitHub and community channels.

5. **Flexibility for Future Features**  
   - Adding TLS, username/password auth, or certificate-based auth is simpler with MQTTnet.  
   - You can integrate advanced data visualization libraries if needed.  
   - If you later decide to expand beyond desktop to mobile, you could consider porting some logic to .NET MAUI (though Avalonia is desktop-focused).

## Alternatives

1. **Electron or Tauri**  
   - **Pros**: Large ecosystem (especially Electron), straightforward web-based UI development.  
   - **Cons**: Electron can be resource-heavy. Tauri is lighter but has a smaller ecosystem.  
   - Packaging as a global tool is possible but less common than .NET’s built-in tooling.

2. **Qt (C++ or Python)**  
   - **Pros**: Very mature, high-performance, truly native on all platforms.  
   - **Cons**: Requires more complex build environments (especially for Python or C++ across OSes). Harder to distribute as a simple global tool without a dedicated installer.

3. **Rust + Tauri**  
   - **Pros**: Excellent performance, small footprint, modern tooling.  
   - **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, especially for GUIs; smaller community for MQTT v5 libraries with advanced features.  

Given your requirements—particularly the global tool distribution, robust library support, and the desire to avoid heavy installers—**.NET + Avalonia** strikes a strong balance of **performance, ease of development, and cross-platform reach**.

Using WebView2 with a TypeScript backend is a compelling alternative, especially if you prefer web technologies and a modern, dynamic development experience. Here are some points to consider:

- **Pros:**
  - **Modern Web Technologies:** You can leverage popular frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) along with TypeScript for strong typing and maintainable code.
  - **Rich UI Possibilities:** Web-based UIs can be highly interactive, customizable, and benefit from a vast ecosystem of UI components.
  - **Rapid Development:** The web ecosystem is mature with plenty of libraries, which can accelerate development.
  - **Separation of Concerns:** A clear split between frontend and backend code can be beneficial for maintenance and potential future web integrations.

- **Cons:**
  - **Performance Overhead:** Although WebView2 provides a modern engine, using a web-based UI might introduce additional overhead compared to a native solution, especially when handling thousands of topics and hundreds of thousands of messages.
  - **Resource Usage:** Web-based UIs typically consume more memory and CPU, which might be a concern under high load conditions.
  - **Packaging & Distribution:** While feasible, packaging a WebView2-based app as a global tool might be more complex compared to a self-contained .NET executable.
  - **Native Integration:** While WebView2 offers good integration with Windows, cross-platform consistency (Linux and macOS) might require additional effort or alternative solutions (like embedding a Chromium-based engine).

- **Overall Recommendation:**
  - If your team is more comfortable with web technologies and you value rapid UI iteration, WebView2 with a TypeScript backend can work well—provided you pay careful attention to performance optimizations (e.g., virtualized lists, throttled UI updates).
  - For scenarios where performance, low latency, and minimal resource usage are paramount (especially with high message volumes), a native solution like .NET with Avalonia might offer better efficiency and smoother cross-platform distribution.

In conclusion, WebView2 with TypeScript is a viable alternative if you’re willing to invest in optimizations and possibly more complex packaging, whereas a native stack may yield more efficient handling of high-throughput MQTT data with simpler distribution as a global tool.

  Building a rich, interactive GUI with features like diff views, tree-views, and complex keyboard navigation might require more custom work in Go compared to platforms with built-in support for such controls.

---

### Summary

A Go-based implementation using packages like **paho.mqtt.golang** for MQTT, **Fyne** (or a webview-based solution) for the GUI, and OpenTelemetry for logging can yield a lightweight, performant, and easily distributable application. It’s particularly strong for scenarios that demand efficiency and simple deployment, though you may need to invest extra effort to achieve advanced UI interactions compared to some other stacks.

Both Go and a native .NET approach have their merits, and the best choice depends on your team’s expertise and priorities regarding performance, UI sophistication, and development speed.
