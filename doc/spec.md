Below is a comprehensive specification that consolidates all of our discussions into a single, developer-ready document. It outlines the requirements, architecture, data handling, error handling, and a suggested testing plan. This should be sufficient for a developer to begin implementation.

---

## 1. Overview

We need to build a cross-platform MQTT v5 client application with a graphical user interface. The primary focus is to **subscribe** to all topics (using the wildcard `#`), **monitor** high volumes of messages, and **visualize** their details in a structured, user-friendly way. The tool should run on **Windows, Linux, and macOS** and be packaged as a developer-friendly global tool rather than a traditional installer.

### Key Points
- **MQTT v5** client.
- Subscribes to `#` with **QoS 1**.
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Focus on **high-performance** message handling and **intuitive** visualization.
- **Dark mode** by default.
- **Vim-like** keyboard navigation.
- Expandable with advanced features in the future (e.g., TLS, user authentication).

---

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

1. **MQTT Connection**  
   - **Broker Settings**:  
     - Hostname and Port (basic).  
     - Advanced options (client ID, keepalive, session timeout, clean session vs. session expiry).  
   - **Subscription**:  
     - Subscribes to `#` (all topics) at QoS 1 by default.  
   - **Reconnect**:  
     - Automatically reconnect if disconnected.  
     - Show detailed notifications on failure (error code, reason string).

2. **Topic & Message Display**  
   - **Topic List Panel**:  
     - Lists all topics with an incremental message count.  
     - Collapsed by default for performance; expands on user interaction.  
   - **Message History Panel**:  
     - Displays a timestamped list of received messages for the selected topic.  
     - Allows pausing/resuming UI updates (still buffering messages in the background).  
     - Allows global reset/clear to empty the ring buffer and reset counters.

3. **Message Details**  
   - **Metadata**:  
     - Message ID, content-type, correlation-data, user-properties, payload-format-indicator, retain flag, message-expiry-interval, timestamp.  
   - **Payload Display**:  
     - **Raw** text or **highlighted JSON** (based on content-type).  
     - If `content-type` is image/jpeg or image/png, **render** the image and allow **zoom** and **save**.  
     - Option to **diff** the payload against the **previous** message on the same topic.

4. **Data Handling**  
   - **Ring Buffer**:  
     - Configurable max size per topic (e.g., 10MB).  
     - Oldest messages replaced when full.  
   - **Storage**:  
     - Start with in-memory.  
     - Option to serialize to local DB (DuckDB or SQLite) if needed.  

5. **Search & Filtering**  
   - **Global Search** with fuzzy matching.  
   - Support contextual searches with `@correlation-data:`, `@message-id:`, `@timestamp:`, etc.  
   - By default, searches payload content and topic names.

6. **Interactive JSON Element View**  
   - **Tree-view** of JSON payload.  
   - Click elements to add them to a **live-updating table** showing last known values across messages.  
   - If some messages lack a field, display no data or “N/A.”

7. **Command System via Global Search Bar**  
   - **Colon-prefixed commands** with auto-completion:  
     - `:connect`, `:disconnect`, `:settings`, `:diagnostic`  
     - `:export` (export messages per MQTT topic)  
     - `:export-all` (export all messages in the ring buffer)  
     - `:verify` (check for missing messages by message-id gaps)  
     - `:stats` (show messages/second and average message size)  
   - Support ephemeral/inline error messages for invalid commands.

8. **User Interactions**  
   - **Keyboard-Only Usage**:  
     - **Vim-like** navigation (h, j, k, l).  
     - `/` to jump to the search bar.  
     - `:w` to save the current message to file.  
     - `yy` to copy the current message (with metadata) as JSON to clipboard.  
   - **UI Controls**:  
     - Buttons to **copy** payload, topic, or entire message as JSON.  
     - Pause/resume toggle for the message view.  
     - Interval-based UI updates (default: 1 second; configurable in advanced settings).  

9. **Error Handling & Diagnostics**  
   - **Transient Toast Notifications**:  
     - Display on command errors or MQTT connection failures.  
     - Quick actions: “Retry” or “Jump to Diagnostics.”  
   - **Diagnostics View**:  
     - Detailed logs of errors, connection status, advanced metrics.  
     - Hidden by default, can be opened via `:diagnostic` command or UI button.

10. **Logging & Metrics**  
    - **OpenTelemetry**-conformant logs and metrics.  
    - Exportable in CSV or JSON.  
    - Option to show/hide logs in a dedicated (hidden-by-default) window.

11. **Packaging & Distribution**  
    - Distributed as a **global tool** (e.g., via dotnet, npm).  
    - No requirement for admin/root privileges.  
    - Possible future distribution via **winget, brew, apt**.  
    - **Built-in self-update** mechanism to notify users of new versions.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Components

1. **Core MQTT Engine**  
   - Manages connection, subscriptions, message reception, and reconnection logic.  
   - Publishes events (new messages, errors) to the rest of the system.

2. **Message Buffer & Storage**  
   - Maintains in-memory ring buffers per topic.  
   - Handles data retention (10MB default, configurable).  
   - (Optional) Integrates with DuckDB/SQLite for persistent storage if enabled.

3. **GUI Layer**  
   - Built with a cross-platform framework (e.g., Qt, Electron, or .NET MAUI—choice left open).  
   - Provides the panels for topics, message history, and details.  
   - Handles search, commands, and keyboard shortcuts.

4. **Command & Search Parser**  
   - Interprets user input from the global search bar.  
   - Executes relevant actions (connect, disconnect, export, etc.).  
   - Provides fuzzy matching for topics and payload searches.

5. **Diagnostics & Logging**  
   - Collects logs, metrics, and error details.  
   - Exposes them via a dedicated UI panel (diagnostics view).  
   - Writes logs in OpenTelemetry format for external tools.

### 3.2 Data Flows

1. **Message Ingestion**  
   - MQTT Engine → Message Buffer (Ring Buffer) → UI Notification  
   - The UI only updates visible topics/messages on an interval to manage performance.

2. **Search/Filter**  
   - User enters query in the global search bar.  
   - Command Parser checks if it’s a command (`:something`) or a search query.  
   - If search, filter topics/messages in memory (with fuzzy matching).  
   - Display results in the main UI panels.

3. **Exporting**  
   - `:export` or `:export-all` triggers data retrieval from ring buffers.  
   - Data is serialized (JSON, CSV) and written to file.

---

## 4. Data Handling

1. **Ring Buffer Implementation**  
   - Each topic has a ring buffer with a fixed maximum size (e.g., 10MB).  
   - When the buffer is about to exceed its limit, the oldest messages are removed first.  
   - Memory usage is tracked globally for UI display.

2. **Optional Persistent Storage**  
   - If the user enables persistent mode, the application writes messages to DuckDB/SQLite.  
   - Must respect the ring buffer’s maximum size policy (delete oldest records when the limit is reached).  

3. **JSON Handling**  
   - For each message with JSON content-type, parse the payload for the tree-view and diff features.  
   - Store parsed JSON in memory for quick access if feasible.

---

## 5. UI/UX Details

1. **Layout**  
   - **Left Panel**: List of topics (collapsed by default).  
     - Shows message count next to each topic.  
   - **Right Panel**: Split between:  
     - **Message History** (top/bottom split or side-by-side).  
     - **Message Details** (metadata, payload view, diff toggle).  
   - **Search Bar** at the top, with a “:” prompt for commands.  
   - **Diagnostic Window** hidden by default; accessible via `:diagnostic`.

2. **Dark Theme**  
   - Use a default dark color scheme with minimal bright elements.  
   - Provide a toggle in settings for light/dark if desired (future expansion).

3. **Vim Keybindings**  
   - `h, j, k, l` for navigation.  
   - `/` to focus search.  
   - `:w` to save current message.  
   - `yy` to copy current message as JSON.  
   - Standard arrow keys, tab, and mouse interactions should also work.

4. **Payload Rendering**  
   - **Raw** text or **JSON** highlight.  
   - **Images** auto-rendered with zoom controls.  
   - **Diff Mode** compares current payload to previous message payload on the same topic.

5. **Pause/Resume**  
   - A global button or command to pause UI updates.  
   - Under the hood, messages still flow into the ring buffer.  
   - Show an icon or badge to indicate paused state and how many messages have arrived since pause.

6. **Interval-Based Updates**  
   - Refresh the UI at a user-configurable interval (default: 1 second).  
   - Keep track of changes in the background to ensure consistency.

---

## 6. Keyboard and Command System

1. **Global Search/Command**  
   - Colon-prefixed commands (`:connect`, `:disconnect`, `:export`, etc.) with auto-completion.  
   - Fuzzy searching for topics and messages if no colon prefix.  
   - Error feedback in transient toast notifications.

2. **Commands**  
   - `:connect` / `:disconnect` — Manage MQTT connection.  
   - `:settings` — Open advanced settings.  
   - `:diagnostic` — Open diagnostic/log view.  
   - `:export [topic]` — Export ring buffer for a single topic.  
   - `:export-all` — Export ring buffer for all topics.  
   - `:verify` — Check for missing messages (gaps in message-id).  
   - `:stats` — Show messages/second and average size.  

3. **Clipboard & Saving**  
   - **Buttons**: Copy payload, topic, or entire message JSON.  
   - **Keyboard**: `yy` copies entire message JSON, `:w` saves the current message to a file.

---

## 7. Logging and Diagnostics

1. **OpenTelemetry Logs & Metrics**  
   - Collect logs for connection events, errors, and performance metrics.  
   - Store them locally for immediate or later analysis.  
   - Exportable as CSV or JSON from the diagnostics view.

2. **Diagnostics View**  
   - Summaries of connection attempts, errors, and command usage.  
   - Filter logs by severity (info, warning, error).

3. **Error Notifications**  
   - **Transient Toast** with “Retry” or “Jump to Diagnostics.”  
   - Detailed stack traces or MQTT error codes in diagnostics.

---

## 8. Error Handling

1. **Command Errors**  
   - On invalid or failed command, show a toast with an option to “retry” or “jump to diagnostics.”  
   - Log error details in the diagnostics window.

2. **MQTT Connection/Subscription Errors**  
   - Automatically attempt reconnection.  
   - If reconnection fails, show toast with reason string/error code and a link to diagnostics.

3. **Ring Buffer Overflows**  
   - When a ring buffer is full, the application quietly removes the oldest messages.  
   - Optionally log a debug-level message in diagnostics if desired.

---

## 9. Performance Considerations

1. **High Message Volume**  
   - Efficiently handle thousands of topics and hundreds of thousands of messages.  
   - Only update the UI for **visible** topics/messages.  
   - Refresh on a set interval (default 1 second) to avoid continuous re-rendering.

2. **Pause/Resume**  
   - Allows users to temporarily freeze the UI updates while continuing to store messages.  
   - Minimizes CPU/GPU usage during extremely high throughput.

3. **Memory Management**  
   - Default ring buffer limit per topic (10MB).  
   - Provide user configuration for advanced memory constraints.  
   - Potential fallback to persistent storage for older messages.

---

## 10. Packaging & Distribution

1. **Global Tool Approach**  
   - No traditional installer or admin privileges.  
   - Use frameworks that allow single-binary or minimal-asset distribution.  
   - Potential distribution via `winget`, `brew`, `apt`, `dotnet tool`, or `npm` in the future.

2. **Self-Update Mechanism**  
   - On startup or at user request, check for newer versions.  
   - Notify user if an update is available, optionally auto-download or direct them to instructions.

---

## 11. Testing Plan

A thorough testing approach should validate both **functionality** and **performance**:

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Core MQTT engine logic (connect, disconnect, reconnect).  
   - Ring buffer operations (insertion, overflow behavior, memory usage).  
   - Command parsing and execution (including edge cases for invalid commands).  
   - JSON parsing/diffing logic.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - End-to-end test with a local MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).  
   - Validate subscription to `#` and correct topic/message displays.  
   - Check metadata extraction (message-id, content-type, user-properties, etc.).  
   - Confirm ring buffer rollover and advanced features (pause/resume, diff mode).

3. **UI Tests**  
   - Automation scripts or manual tests to verify panel resizing, dark theme, search bar functionality, command bar.  
   - Keyboard shortcuts: ensure vim-like navigation, `:w`, `yy`, etc.  
   - Rendering of JSON payloads, images, and diff view.

4. **Performance Tests**  
   - High-throughput scenario: thousands of topics and hundreds of thousands of messages.  
   - Ensure the UI remains responsive with interval-based updates.  
   - Validate memory usage does not exceed expected limits with the ring buffer approach.

5. **Error Handling Tests**  
   - Simulate broker disconnections, invalid credentials (later), or invalid commands.  
   - Confirm transient toast notifications and diagnostics logging.  
   - Check self-update mechanism with a mocked “new version” scenario.

6. **Cross-Platform Validation**  
   - Windows, Linux, and macOS environment tests.  
   - Verify no OS-specific issues with file paths, permissions, or packaging.

---

## 12. Future Extensions (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

- **Security**: Username/password or certificate-based authentication, TLS/SSL.  
- **User Management**: Handling different broker credentials or multi-profile usage.  
- **Topic-Specific Settings**: Different ring buffer sizes or QoS levels per topic.  
- **Light Theme Toggle**: Option to switch from dark mode.  
- **Plugin System**: Triggers or custom scripts on incoming messages.

---
